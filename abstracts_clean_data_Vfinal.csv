1,JLD,56,5,2023,Compounding Effects of Domain-General Cognitive Weaknesses and Word Reading Difficulties on Anxiety Symptoms in Youth,Nina Anderson,EXP,"This study examined whether domain-general cognitive weaknesses in processing speed (PS) or executive functioning (EF) moderate the relation between word reading scores and anxiety such that lower word reading scores in combination with lower cognitive scores are associated with higher anxiety symptoms. The sample consisted of 755 youth ages 8Ð16 who were recruited as part of the Colorado Learning Disabilities Research Center twins study. Lower scores on PS (R2Ê= .007,ÊpÊ= .014), EF (R2Ê= .009,ÊpÊ= .006), and word reading (R2Ê= .006Ð.008,ÊpÊ= .010Ð.032) were associated with higher anxiety scores. In addition, the word reading _ cognitive interactions were significant such that lower scores on PS (R2Ê= .010,ÊpÊ= .005) or EF (R2Ê= .013,ÊpÊ= .010)ÊcombinedÊwith lower word reading were associated with higher-than-expected anxiety symptoms. Results suggest that weaknesses in PS, EF, and word reading are modestly associated with higher anxiety symptoms, and these anxiety symptoms may be compounded in youth with both PS or EF weaknesses and word reading difficulties. These findings can guide assessment approaches for identifying youth with word reading challenges who may be at increased risk for anxiety.",179,0.0,0.0,44.6927374301676,22.3463687150838,5.58659217877095,1
2,JLD,56,5,2023,Sociodemographic Disparities in Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder Overdiagnosis and Overtreatment During Elementary School,Paul Morgan,Non-EXP,"Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) overdiagnosis and overtreatment unnecessarily exposes children to potential harm and contributes to provider and community skepticism toward those with moderate or severe symptoms and significant impairments, resulting in less supportive care. Yet, which sociodemographic groups of children are overdiagnosed and overtreated for ADHD is poorly understood. We conducted descriptive and logistic regression analyses of a population-based subsample of 1,070 U.S. elementary schoolchildren who had displayed above-average levels of independently assessed behavioral, academic, or executive functioning the year prior to their initial ADHD diagnoses and who did not have prior diagnostic histories. Among these children, (a) 27% of White children versus 19% of non-White children were later diagnosed with ADHD and (b) 20% of White children versus 14% of non-White children were later using medication. In adjusted analyses, White children are more likely to later be diagnosed (odds ratio [OR] range = 1.70Ð2.62) and using medication (OR range = 1.70Ð2.37) among those whose prior behavioral, academic, and executive functioning suggested that they were unlikely to have ADHD.",175,0.0,0.0,51.42857142857143,5.714285714285714,0.0,0
3,JLD,56,5,2023,"Reading and Math Achievement in Children With Dyslexia, Developmental Language Disorder, or Typical Development: Achievement Gaps Persist From Second Through Fourth Grades",Dawna Duff,EXP,"We examined how children (N = 448) with separate or co-occurring developmental language disorder (DLD) and dyslexia performed on school-based measures of academic functioning between second and fourth grades. Children were recruited from 1 school district in the U.S. state of South Carolina via classroom screenings and met common research criteria for DLD and dyslexia. Growth curve models were used to examine the overall form of growth and differences between groups. Children with DLD and/or dyslexia in second grade showed early and persistent deficits on school-administered measures of reading and math. In second grade, children with typical development (TD) scored significantly higher than children with dyslexia-only and DLD-only, who did not differ from each other. Children with DLD+dyslexia scored significantly lower than all other groups. Only small differences in growth rates were observed, and gaps in second grade did not close. Despite lower academic performance, few children (20%Ð27%) with dyslexia and/or DLD had received specialized support services. Children with DLD-only received services at less than half the rate of dyslexia-only or DLD+dyslexia despite similar impacts on academic performance. Evidence of significant and persistent functional impacts in the context of low rates of support services in these childrenÑespecially those with DLD-onlyÑhighlights the need to raise awareness of these disorders.",216,0.0,0.0,37.03703703703704,13.888888888888888,4.62962962962963,1

However, latest research also suggests that the instant and sustained effects of EF training remain inconsistent. In this study, 32 Chinese students with MD, age 7 to 10 years, were recruited and randomly divided into two groups: the training group (nÊ= 16, 25 training sessions) and the control group (nÊ= 16). Both groups took a pretest, a posttest, and a follow-up test (after 6 months) on EF, fluid intelligence, and mathematics skills. In the posttest, the training groupÕs performance significantly improved in 2-back, number shifting, letter shifting, calculation fluency, and mathematics problem-solving tasks, but not in Stroop, Flanker, 1-back, numerical operations, and colored progressive matrices tasks. In the follow-up test after 6 months, the effects of training only on the 2-back and letter shifting tasks were sustained. The effect on the numerical operations task appeared; however, the effects on number shifting, calculation fluency, and mathematics problem-solving tasks disappeared. The results of this study show that EF training has instant effects of improving EF and mathematics skills of students with MD, and 6-month sustained effects on some of the improved skills. However, for fluid intelligence, the effects may be very limited.",222,0.0,0.0,31.531531531531527,9.00900900900901,9.00900900900901,1

However, this skill has never been systematically studied, either in children with typical development (TD) or in children with specific learning disabilities (SLD). The aim of this research was to study the features of a copy task and its relationship with other writing tasks. For this purpose, 674 children with TD and 65 children with SLD from Grades 6 through 8 in Italy were tested with a copy task and other writing assessment tasks, measuring three aspects of writing: handwriting speed, spelling, and expressive writing. Children with SLD performed worse on the copy task, both in terms of speed and accuracy, than children with TD. Copy speed was predicted by grade level and by all three major writing skills for children with TD but only by handwriting speed and spelling for children with SLD. Copy accuracy was predicted by gender and the three major writing skills for children with TD but only by spelling for children with SLD. These results suggest that children with SLD also have difficulty copying a text and benefit less than children with TD from their other writing skills.",198,0.0,0.0,30.303030303030305,5.050505050505051,0.0,0

However, the vast majority of Tier 2 intervention studies do not account for Tier 1 variables when examining intervention effectiveness. The purpose of this study was to examine Tier 1 predictors, or Òquality indicators,Ó of differential responsiveness to Tier 2 mathematics intervention. Data were drawn from a large-scale data set where all teachers taught the Early Learning in Mathematics (Tier 1) core program across the academic year, and a subset of students were selected for the ROOTS (Tier 2) mathematics intervention. We examined the following Tier 1 variables: (a) classroom-level mathematics gains, (b) Tier 1 fidelity of implementation, (c) Tier 1 classroom management and instructional support, and (d) class size. Response to Tier 2 intervention was not significantly predicted by any of the Tier 1 variables examined; however, the pattern of HedgesÕÊgÊeffect sizes suggested that students with higher quality of Tier 1 instruction tended to benefit less from the Tier 2 ROOTS intervention.

7,JLD,56,4,2023,What Skills Could Distinguish Developmental Dyscalculia and Typically Developing Children: Evidence From a 2-Year Longitudinal Screening,Danfeng Li,Non-EXP,"Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a mathematics learning disorder that affects approximately 5% to 7% of the population. This study aimed to detect the underlying domain-specific and domain-general differences between DD and typically developing (TD) children. We recruited 9-year-old primary school children to form the DD group via a 2-year longitudinal screening process. In total, 75 DD children were screened from 1,657 children after the one-time screening, and 13 DD children were screened from 1,317 children through a consecutive 2-year longitudinal screening. In total, 13 experimental tasks were administered to assess their cognitive abilities to test the domain-specific magnitude representation hypothesis (including symbolic and nonsymbolic magnitude comparisons) and four alternative domain-general hypotheses (including working memory, executive function, attention, and visuospatial processing). The DD group had worse performance than the TD group on the number sense task, finger sense task, shifting task, and one-back task after both one-time and two-time screening. Logistic regressions further indicated the differences on the shifting task and the nonsymbolic magnitude comparison task could distinguish DD and TD children. Our findings suggest that domain-specific nonsymbolic magnitude representation and domain-general executive function both contribute to DD. Thus, both domain-specific and domain-general abilities will be necessary to investigate and to intervene in DD groups in the future.",223,0.0,0.0,49.327354260089685,4.484304932735426,4.484304932735426,0
8,JLD,56,4,2023,Severe Pandemic Learning Loss and the Promise of Remotely Delivered Intervention in Students With Comorbid Reading and Mathematics Learning Difficulty,Lynn Fuchs,EXP,"Analyses were conducted with second graders, drawn from an ongoing multi-cohort randomized controlled trial (RCT), who had been identified for RCT entry based on comorbid reading comprehension and word-problem solving difficulty. To estimate pandemic learning loss, we contrasted fall performance for 3 cohorts: fall of 2019 (pre-pandemic;ÊnÊ= 47), 2020 (early pandemic, when performance was affected by the truncated preceding school year;ÊnÊ= 35), and 2021 (later pandemic, when performance was affected by the truncated 2019 to 2020 school year plus the subsequent yearÕs ongoing interruptions;ÊnÊ= 75). Across the 2 years, declines (standard deviations below expected growth) were approximately 3 times larger than those reported for the general population and for students in high-poverty schools. To estimate the promise of structured remote intervention for addressing such learning loss during extended school closures, we contrasted effects in the RCTÕs 2018 to 2019 cohort (entirely in-person intervention delivery;ÊnÊ= 66) against the same interventionÕs effects in the 2020 to 2021 cohort (alternating periods of remote and in-person delivery;ÊnÊ= 29). Large intervention effects were not moderated by pandemic status, suggesting potential for structured remote intervention to address student needs during extended school closures.",193,0.0,0.0,51.81347150259067,10.362694300518134,10.362694300518134,1

Dyscalculia has high comorbidity with other learning and developmental disabilities, including reading and writing disorders, attention deficits, and problems in visual/spatial skills, short memory, and working memory. This study aims to assess prevalence rates for isolated as well as comorbid DD in a sample of Italian-speaking children. In addition, we studied the neuropsychological profile of children with isolated or combined dyscalculia. We tested 380 children (176 males and 204 females) between the ages of 8.17 and 9.33 years using an extensive battery to determine the neuropsychological profile. The assessment included an arithmetic battery and nonverbal intelligence, short-term memory, reading, and writing tests. The results indicated that children with DD more frequently have a reading disorder and writing disorder. They also have a lower nonverbal intelligence quotient (IQ) and obtain significantly lower scores in short-term memory tests and on a visuospatial skills questionnaire. They also had significantly higher scores (indicative of greater attentional difficulties) on the Conners subscale for attentional problems. Children with DD present different cognitive and neuropsychological profiles.",186,0.0,0.0,80.64516129032258,5.376344086021506,0.0,0
10,JLD,56,3,2023,Special and General Education TeachersÕ Beliefs About Writing and Writing Instruction,Steve Graham,Non-EXP,"Seventy-six general education and 67 special education teachers working in the same 66 elementary schools were surveyed about their beliefs about writing. Each teacher taught writing to one or more fourth-grade students receiving special education services, including students with learning disabilities. Survey findings indicated that general education teachers believed that they were better prepared to teach writing than special education teachers, and they were more positive about their own efforts to learn to teach writing. General education teachers also held more positive attitudes about teaching writing and their own capabilities as a writer than their special education counterparts. Furthermore, general educators were more likely than special educators to indicate that writing developed through effort and process, and less likely to think that writing knowledge came from experts. Beliefs about adequacy of preparation to teach writing predicted teachersÕ beliefs about their level of knowledge to teach writing, efficacy to overcome studentsÕ writing difficulties, and attitudes toward teaching writing.

11,JLD,56,3,2023,Which Students With Disabilities are Placed Primarily Outside of U.S. Elementary School General Education Classrooms?,Paul Morgan,Non-EXP,"Students with disabilities (SWD) who are Black or Hispanic have been reported to be more likely to be placed primarily outside of general education classrooms while attending U.S. schools. Federal law and regulation require monitoring of special education placement based on race or ethnicity. Yet, whether and to what extent racial or ethnic disparities in placement are explained by bias or by other explanatory factors is currently unclear. We evaluated for racial and ethnic bias in special education placement by analyzing longitudinal data from two independent samples of SWD (NÊvalues range 590Ð1,130) attending U.S. elementary schools. We statistically controlled for plausibly exogenous sociodemographic, academic, and behavioral risk factors measured in kindergarten in analyses of the students as they attended first, third, and fifth grades between the 1999Ð2000 and 2015Ð2016 school years. Of the resulting 12 Black or Hispanic grade-yearÐspecific tests, 11 (i.e., 92%) indicated that controls for kindergarten explanatory factorsÑparticularly significant academic difficultiesÑfully explained the risk initially attributable to race or ethnicity. We observed little evidence that bias explains racial or ethnic disparities in special education placement in U.S. elementary schools.",182,0.0,0.0,38.46153846153847,27.47252747252747,0.0,0

As such interventions become commercially available and marketed to preschool programs, it is important to understand their impacts when implemented by intended end users under routine conditions. In this study, we examined the effects of the Nemours BrightStart! (NBS!) intervention on childrenÕs emergent literacy skills when implemented by teachers and community aides in authentic preschool classrooms. We randomly assigned 98 classrooms to one of three conditions (NBS! teacher-implemented, NBS! community aide-implemented, or control). Children enrolled in these classrooms who met eligibility criteria and were identified as at risk via an early literacy screener (nÊ= 281) completed pretest and posttest emergent literacy assessments; those assigned to NBS! conditions received intervention from their classroom teacher or a community aide affiliated with a local kindergarten-readiness initiative. Intent-to-treat analyses showed no significant impacts of NBS! on any outcome, and an instrumental variable, as-treated approach showed one significant intervention effect on letter writing. Consequently, we did not replicate results of prior highly controlled efficacy trials. Findings have implications for revising the NBS! theory of change, conducting dosage and as-treated analyses, and moving research-based interventions toward scale-up.",210,0.0,0.0,61.904761904761905,14.285714285714285,9.523809523809526,1

The primary aims of the study were to (a) test the associations between mathematics difficulties and specific components of internalizing, externalizing, attention, and social problems; (b) examine potential age and gender differences; and (c) investigate the longitudinal relationship between mathematics and psychopathology using 5-year follow-up data. Results indicated that individuals with mathematics difficulties exhibited elevations in most dimensions of psychopathology, including anxiety, depression, externalizing behaviors, attention problems, and social problems. Furthermore, mathematics impairment was associated with internalizing problems, rule-breaking behaviors, inattention, and social problems even after controlling for comorbid reading difficulties. Results suggested that the associations between mathematics and psychopathology are generally similar in males and females. Finally, preliminary longitudinal evidence suggested that initial mathematics difficulties predicted elevations of conduct disorder, rule-breaking behavior, inattention, hyperactivity, and social problems at follow-up, with several of these associations remaining significant even after controlling for initial reading. In contrast, there was no significant association between initial mathematics ability and internalizing symptoms at follow-up, demonstrating some amelioration of internalizing symptoms over time.",200,0.0,0.0,55.0,15.0,0.0,0

Multivariate growth mixture modeling yielded four classes of combined reading and mathematics trajectories for students with LD. The largest class of students with LD (Class 2, 54.3%) showed meanÊT-scores for both achievement domains that averaged about 1ÊSDÊbelow the mean, with modest decline over time. Almost a quarter of the sample (Class 1, 22.3%) displayed meanÊT-scores in both achievement areas near the peer-normed average; these students were mostly White, from higher socioeconomic status (SES) backgrounds, and had experienced earlier identification as having an LD as well as shorter duration of LD service.

15,JLD,56,1,2023,Do Struggling Adult Readers Monitor Their Reading? Understanding the Role of Online and Offline Comprehension Monitoring Processes During Reading,Elizabeth Tighe,EXP,"Comprehension monitoring is a meta-cognitive skill that is defined as the ability to self-evaluate oneÕs comprehension of text. Although it is known that struggling adult readers are poor at monitoring their comprehension, additional research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying comprehension monitoring and their role in reading comprehension in this population. This study used a comprehension monitoring task with struggling adult readers, which included online eye movements (reread and regression path durations) and an offline verbal protocol (oral explanations of key information). We examined whether eye movements predicted accuracy on the passagesÕ reading comprehension questions, a norm-referenced reading assessment, and an offline verbal protocol after controlling for age and traditional component skills (i.e., decoding, oral language, working memory). Regression path duration uniquely predicted accuracy on the questions; however, decoding and oral vocabulary were the most salient predictors of the norm-referenced reading comprehension measure. Regression path duration also predicted the offline verbal protocol, such that those who exhibited longer regression path duration were also better at explaining key information. These results contribute to the literature regarding struggling adultsÕ reading component skills, eye movement behaviors involved in processing connected text, and future considerations in assessing comprehension monitoring.",200,5.0,5.0,95.0,20.0,0.0,1
16,JLD,56,1,2023,Exploring Thresholds in the Foundational Skills for Reading and Comprehension Outcomes in the Context of Postsecondary Readers,Joseph Magliano,Non-EXP,"There is a range of reasons why college students may be underprepared to read, but one possibility is that some college students are below a threshold of proficiency in the component skills of reading. The presence of thresholds means that when students fall below that threshold, their proficiency in that component skill of reading is not sufficient for there to be a relationship with comprehension performance. The present study assessed (a) whether there were thresholds in proficiencies in foundational skills, (b) whether students falling below the thresholds were disproportionately in developmental literary programs (i.e., institutionally designated as underprepared), and (c) the implications of being below the thresholds on engaging in strategic processing during reading. College students were administered assessments of foundational literacy skills, text comprehension, and strategic processing of texts. The sample included students who were enrolled in developmental literacy programs and students who were not. Thresholds were found in the foundational skills associated with word-, sentence-, and discourse-level processing. Participants below these thresholds were represented disproportionately by students determined to be underprepared for college and assigned to developmental literacy programs. Finally, students falling below the thresholds demonstrated lower reading strategy scores than students above the threshold.",198,0.0,0.0,15.151515151515152,35.35353535353535,0.0,0

The data were obtained for 579 Finnish children (8Ð15 years) with reading disability (RD-only), math disability (MD-only), or both (RDMD) assessed at a specialized clinic between 1985 and 2017. We analyzed percentages of children with behavioral-emotional symptoms reaching clinical range (i.e.,ÊzÊscore ³1.5ÊSDs) and the effects of the LD type, gender, and context (home vs. school) on them. Furthermore, we analyzed the effect of the severity of LD and gender on the amount of behavioral-emotional symptoms reported by teachers and parents. Alarmingly high percentages of children, irrespective of LD type, demonstrated behavioral-emotional problems: more than 37% in Affective, Anxiety, and Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) problems. Contextual variation was large, as more problems were reported by teachers than by mothers. The unique effects of gender and LD type were rare, but the results raised concern for those with MD-only, especially boys. The results underscore the need to draw attention to the importance of assessing children with LD for behavioral-emotional problems and emphasize the importance of teachersÕ awareness of behavioral-emotional problems among students with LD and cooperation among child, teacher, and parents in assessment and support planning.",213,0.0,0.0,56.33802816901409,4.694835680751174,0.0,0
18,JLD,55,6,2022,The Use of Phonological and Semantic Strategies in Written Word Learning Among Chinese Children With Dyslexia,Yixun Li,EXP,"The present study investigated the phonological and semantic aspects of written word learning among children with dyslexia, taking into account their use of phonetic and semantic cues embedded in words. Fifty-three Mandarin-speaking fifth graders were taught the pronunciations and meanings of 24 Chinese single-character pseudowords (children with dyslexia:ÊnÊ= 27; age-matched peers:ÊnÊ= 26). The regularity of phonetic cues and the transparency of semantic cues embedded in the characters were experimentally manipulated. ChildrenÕs learning outcomes in orthography-to-pronunciation associations (learning the pronunciations of novel characters) and orthography-to-meaning associations (learning the meanings of novel characters) were examined separately. Results indicated that children with dyslexia performed more poorly than did their peers only in the learning stage of orthography-to-pronunciation learning. Otherwise, children with dyslexia demonstrated comparable performance in orthography-to-meaning learning, in the use of embedded pronunciation and meaning cues, and in retention of learning in comparison with their peers. Children applied phonetic and semantic cues jointly in the learning stage. For the 1-week retention, phonetic cues supported childrenÕs performance on the task of orthography-to-pronunciation associations, whereas semantic cues aided in that of orthography-to-meaning associations.

Yet, most of these studies were in alphabetic languages, whereas few of them examined Chinese DD. Here, we conducted a study aiming to determine the cognitive factors associated with DD in Chinese children. Five candidate cognitive factors of DDÑphonological retrieval, phonological awareness, visualÐspatial attention, spatial thinking, and pattern understandingÑwere examined in the present study. A total of 904 Chinese children ages 8 to 11 years participated in this study. From the sample, 97 children were identified with DD through tests of arithmetic ability, and 93 age- and IQ-matched typically developing children were selected as controls. Logistic regression analysis revealed that phonological retrieval, pattern understanding, visualÐspatial attention, and phonological awareness significantly predicted DD, whereas spatial thinking failed to do so. Results of logistic relative weights analysis showed that all five factors explained statistically significant amounts of variance in arithmetic scores. Phonological retrieval had the most influence on DD, followed by pattern understanding, visualÐspatial attention, phonological awareness, and spatial thinking.

At-risk (LMÊnÊ= 70; non-LMÊnÊ= 89) and not-at-risk (LMÊnÊ= 44; non-LMÊnÊ= 114) students were evaluated on foundational academic (word reading, calculation), behavioral (behavioral attention), cognitive (working memory, processing speed, nonverbal reasoning), and language (vocabulary, listening comprehension) measures in English. Results indicated listening comprehension was the only shared risk factor for higher order comorbidity. Furthermore, LM learners were 3 times more likely to be identified as at risk compared with non-LM learners. Finally, among at-risk learners, no differences were found on cognitive dimensions by language status, but LM learners had lower reading and listening comprehension skills than non-LM learners, with a relative advantage in behavioral attention. Results have implications for understanding higher order comorbidity and for developing methods to identify and intervene with higher order comorbidity among the growing population of LM learners.",205,0.0,0.0,48.78048780487805,4.878048780487805,0.0,0

These children could benefit from more efficient intervention responses, providing a better understanding of their cognitive weaknesses/deficits. Our aim was to explore the cognitive heterogeneity of a population of poor readers identified from a large sample of 948 sixth-grade children. We first assessed the contribution of phoneme awareness (PA), rapid automatized naming (RAN), and visual attention span (VAS) to reading performance in a subset of 281 children including poor and average readers/spellers. We show that all three skills are unique and significant predictors of reading fluency. We then restricted the analysis to participants with normal RavenÕs score (IQ) and oral language skills to focus on 110 children with more specific reading difficulties. A unique VAS deficit was found in 18% of these poor readers while 20% and 15.5% showed a unique PA or RAN deficit. Children with multiple or no deficit were further identified. The overall findings provide evidence for a variety of cognitive profiles in poor readers.

Results also demonstrated that word reading proficiency at pretest was related to response to intervention on reading comprehension measures. Students in the very low word reading proficiency cluster showed minimal response to intervention whereas the near-adequate word reading cluster demonstrated greatest response to intervention.

They were assessed on the cognitive-linguistic measures of morphological awareness, phonological awareness, vocabulary knowledge, rapid naming, word reading, and word spelling in L1 and L2. Multivariate analysis of variance showed that compared with the typical students, adolescents with dyslexia had poorer performance in all L1 and L2 measures except the phonological awareness in Chinese. Hierarchical regression analysis indicated that for both groups of students, morphological awareness contributed uniquely to word reading and spelling in L1 and L2; rapid letter naming contributed uniquely to English word spelling. Findings highlight the importance of co-occurring difficulties in L1 and L2 reading and spelling and that morphological awareness may play a critical role in predicting word reading and spelling across languages for Chinese adolescents with dyslexia and those without difficulty.",203,0.0,0.0,44.33497536945813,19.704433497536947,4.926108374384237,1

Stevens,EXP,"Schema instruction improves word-problem solving for students with mathematics difficulty (MD; e.g.,ÊPowell et al., 2015); however, prior research suggests that students need word-problem-specific language comprehension in addition to schema knowledge to build word-problem models (ÊFuchs et al., 2015,Ê2018). Students have general word knowledge (e.g.,Êmore, less) but require word-problem-specific word knowledge to solve word problems successfully (e.g.,Êmore than, less than;ÊKintsch & Greeno, 1985). Prior word-problem schema interventions have not provided explicit instruction in word-problem vocabulary to support studentsÕ development of word-problem models. We aimed to determine if word-problem vocabulary instruction combined with schema instruction provided an advantage to word-problem solving for third-grade students with MD. We randomly assigned 75 third graders with MD to three conditions: Word-problem intervention with explicit vocabulary instruction (WP_+_V), word-problem intervention without explicit vocabulary instruction (WP-only), and business-as-usual intervention (BAU). Students in the treatment conditions received 22, 50-min lessons provided virtually in small groups. On a word-problem vocabulary measure, students in the WP_+_V condition significantly outperformed students in the WP-only (ES_=_0.43) and BAU (ES_=_0.83) conditions.

To this end, children (NÊ= 394) in Grades 1, 2, and 3 were administered a battery of vocabulary, reading, math, and cognitive measures in both Spanish and English. Three important findings occurred. First, five latent classes emerged (average achievers, poor achievers, reading disabled, English language learners, Spanish-dominant achievers) that varied in language and achievement scores. Second, probability estimates indicated that 10% of the total sample was at risk for learning disabilities (below cutoff score), and approximately 40% of the sample reflected a language acquisition group not at risk for academic difficulties. Finally, the best model for correctly predicting the odds of latent classes differing from average achievers included English measures of short-term memory, naming speed, and the executive component of working memory. The results support the notion that statistically distinct latent classes emerge under the umbrella of children identified as English learners and that children at risk for specific learning disabilities can be separated among a heterogeneous sample of children who are acquiring English as a second language.",194,0.0,0.0,46.391752577319586,15.463917525773196,5.154639175257732,0

Of each 30-minute intervention session (48 over 16 weeks), 25 minutes were identical in the two variants, focused on number knowledge that provides the conceptual bases for arithmetic. The other five minutes provided nonspeeded conceptual practice (nÊ= 196) or speeded strategic practice (nÊ= 199).

Coyne,EXP,We investigated whether individual differences in overall receptive vocabulary knowledge measured at the beginning of the year moderated the effects of a kindergarten vocabulary intervention that supplemented classroom vocabulary instruction. We also examined whether moderation would offset the benefits of providing Tier-2 vocabulary intervention within a multitiered-system-of-support (MTSS) or response-to-intervention framework. Participants included students from two previous studies identified as at risk for language and learning difficulties who were randomly assigned in clusters to receive small-group vocabulary intervention in addition to classroom vocabulary instruction (nÊ= 825) or to receive classroom vocabulary instruction only (nÊ= 781). A group of not-at-risk students (nÊ= 741) who received classroom vocabulary instruction served as a reference group. Initial vocabulary knowledge measured at pretest moderated the impact of intervention on experimenter-developed measures of expressive vocabulary learning and listening comprehension favoring students with higher initial vocabulary knowledge. Tier-2 intervention substantially counteracted the Matthew effect for target word learning. Intervention effects on listening comprehension depended on studentsÕ initial vocabulary knowledge.

While dyscalculics were less accurate than controls, their performance was well above chance level. The performance of controls but not of those with developmental dyscalculia (DD) improved consistently for smaller problem sizes. The performance of both groups was superior when the reference number was smaller (vs. larger) than the exact answer and when it was far (vs. close) from it, both of which are considered to be the markers of the approximate number system (ANS). Strategy analysis distinguished between an approximated calculation strategy and a sense of magnitude strategy, which does not involve any calculation but relies entirely on the ANS. Dyscalculics used the latter more often than controls. The present results suggest that there is little, if any, impairment in the ANS of adults with DD and that their main deficiency is with performing operations on magnitudes rather than with the representations of the magnitudes themselves.",191,0.0,0.0,26.17801047120419,41.88481675392671,0.0,0

Differential Impairments in Different Subgroups of Children With Mathematics Difficulties,Terry T - Y Wong,Non-EXP,"Developmental dyscalculia (DD) is a specific learning disability in mathematics that affects around 6% of the population. Currently, the core deficit of DD remains unknown. While the number sense deficit hypothesis suggests that the core deficit of DD lies in the inability to represent nonsymbolic numerosity, the access deficit hypothesis suggests that the origin of this disability lies in the inability to associate numbers with the underlying magnitude representation. The present study compared the performance of DDs with their low-achieving (LA) and normally achieving peers in nonsymbolic numerosity processing and number-magnitude mapping over 1 year (from kindergarten to 1st grade). The results demonstrated differential impairments in different subgroups of children with mathematics difficulties. While DDs showed deficits in both nonsymbolic numerosity processing and number-magnitude mapping, LAs showed deficit only in the number-magnitude mapping. Furthermore, the deficit in number-magnitude mapping among the DD group was partially explained by their number sense deficit. The number sense deficit hypothesis is supported.

However, it is unclear whether it strengthens comprehension in young children who are at risk for learning difficulties. We conducted a modest study of whether the training of verbal WM would improve verbal WM and passage listening comprehension and whether training effects differed between two approaches: training with and without strategy instruction. A total of 58 first-grade children were randomly assigned to three groups: WM training with a rehearsal strategy, WM training without strategy instruction, and controls. Each member of the two training groups received a one-to-one, 35-min session of verbal WM training on each of 10 consecutive school days, totaling 5.8 hr. Both training groups improved on trained verbal WM tasks, with the rehearsal group making greater gains. Without correction for multiple group comparisons, the rehearsal group made reliable improvements over controls on an untrained verbal WM task and on passage listening comprehension and listening retell measures. The no-strategy-instruction group outperformed controls on passage listening comprehension. When corrected for multiple contrasts, these group differences disappeared but were associated with moderate to large effect sizes.

This study examined contributions of executive skills to reading competence in 761 children of minority backgrounds. Hierarchical linear regressions examined unique contributions of executive functions (EF) to word reading, fluency, and comprehension. EF contributed uniquely to reading performance, over and above reading-related language skills; working memory contributed uniquely to all components of reading; while attentional switching, but not problem solving, contributed to isolated and contextual word reading and reading fluency. Problem solving uniquely predicted comprehension, suggesting that this skill may be especially important for reading comprehension in minority youth.

According to numerous studies, one of the primary reasons for dyscalculia is related to improper understanding of the mental number line. Children with dyscalculia usually show difficulty when they have to place Arabic numbers on a physical number line. However, it remains unclear whether they have a deficit with the mental number line per se or a deficit with accessing it from nonsymbolic and/or symbolic numbers. Quebec French-speaking 8- to 9-year-old children with (24) and without (37) dyscalculia were assessed with transcoding tasks (number-to-positionÊandÊposition-to-number) designed to assess the acuity of the mental number line with Arabic and spoken numbers as well as with analogic numerosities. Results showed that children with dyscalculia produced a larger percentage absolute error than children without mathematics difficulties in every task except the number-to-position transcoding task with analogic numerosities. Hence, these results suggested that children with dyscalculia do not have a general deficit of the mental number line but rather a deficit with accessing it from symbolic numbers.",188,0.0,0.0,53.191489361702125,26.595744680851062,5.319148936170213,0

The GD group displayed weaknesses with both symbolic and nonsymbolic number processing, whereas the AFD group displayed problems only with symbolic number processing. These findings provide evidence that the origins of DD in children with different profiles of mathematical problems diverge.

A total of 31 children with dyslexia, mean age 9 years, were compared to typically developing groups of children: the first matched by age, the second by spelling ability. Oral vocabulary was measured and children completed a written and verbal compositional task. Lexical diversity comparisons were made across written and verbal compositions to highlight the constraint of having to select and spell words. A digital writing tablet recorded the writing. Children with dyslexia and the spelling-ability group made a high proportion of spelling errors and within-word pauses, and had a lower lexical diversity within their written compositions compared to their verbal compositions. The age-matched peers demonstrated the opposite pattern. Spelling ability and pausing predicted 53% of the variance in written lexical diversity of children with dyslexia, demonstrating the link between spelling and vocabulary when writing.

Effect sizes obtained for all measures fell within or exceeded the upper bound of the effects reported in the initial study. Implications for systematically situating replication studies in larger frameworks of intervention research and reporting rates of treatment response across replication studies are discussed.",180,0.0,0.0,33.333333333333336,0.0,0.0,1
